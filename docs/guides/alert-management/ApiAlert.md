# Api Alert

Welcome to **Skylogs** – your all-in-one alert management platform designed for seamless integration with any observability stack. Whether you're managing cloud infrastructure or application monitoring, Skylogs empowers both **shared responsibility** and **personal customization**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Skylogs offers a powerful **REST API** to manage alerts across your stack. You’ll need:

* An API token (issued when creating alert rules)
* Your alert rules set up in the dashboard
* Endpoint configurations (SMS, Email, Telegram, Teams, etc.)

---

## 🔧 Creating an API Alert Rule

To begin, create an **Alert Rule** via the Skylogs web dashboard. Once created, you'll receive an **API token** which authorizes alert API usage.

---

## 🔔 Firing an Alert

Fire an alert by sending a POST request to the following endpoint:

```
POST https://mydomain.com/api/v1/fire-alert
```

### Headers

```
Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Body

```json
{
  "instance": "user-instance",
  "description": "an optional string"
}
```

* `instance` (required): A unique identifier for the alert instance.
* `description` (optional): Any additional context for the alert.

> 📝 Each fired instance is handled independently. Fire as many as you need, each with a unique `instance` ID.

---

## ✅ Resolving an Alert

Stop or resolve an active alert with:

```
POST https://mydomain.com/api/v1/stop-alert
```

### Headers

```
Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Body

```json
{
  "instance": "user-instance",
  "description": "an optional string"
}
```

* Use the same `instance` value you used to fire the alert.

> ⚠️ Each instance must be resolved separately.

---

## 📡 Endpoints for Notifications

You can set up various **notification endpoints** to be triggered when alerts fire or resolve. Supported types:

* 📩 Email
* 📞 Call
* 📬 SMS
* 📢 Telegram
* 👥 Microsoft Teams

These can be configured in the dashboard and attached to specific alerts.

---

## 👥 Shared Access & Customization

Skylogs encourages **collaboration**. You can:

* Add other **users** to an alert.
* Allow them to **attach their own endpoints** to receive notifications.
* Maintain **custom responsibility** over alert behavior per user.

> 🔐 Each user needs appropriate permissions to modify or observe alerts.

---

## 🧪 Example Use Case

Let’s say you manage a Kubernetes cluster:

1. Create an alert rule called `api-server-down`.
2. Fire an alert if the API server is unreachable.
3. Attach:

    * Your email and SMS endpoints
    * Your teammate adds a Telegram endpoint
4. Once resolved, call the stop alert endpoint.

---

## 📘 Best Practices

* Use meaningful `instance` names to trace issues easily.
* Stop every alert to maintain clean logs.
* Share alerts responsibly using Skylogs’ user-level control.
