# Skylogs

**Skylogs** is an open-source alert and incident management platform that helps teams detect issues faster, respond more effectively, and stay in control during incidents.

It sits between your **observability tools** and your **on-call teams**, turning raw alerts into clear, actionable incidents — and making sure the right people are notified at the right time.

If you already use monitoring tools but struggle with alert noise, missed notifications, or unclear incident ownership, **Skylogs** is built to solve exactly that.

## Why Skylogs?

Modern systems generate alerts from many different tools. While those tools are excellent at detecting problems, they often stop there — leaving teams to manually figure out what to do next.

This commonly results in:

- 🔕 Alert fatigue and noisy notifications
- ❓ Lack of context around alerts
- 👤 Unclear incident ownership
- ⏱️ Slow or inconsistent escalation during outages

Skylogs bridges this gap by acting as a **central incident response layer**. It collects alerts from multiple sources, reduces noise, creates incidents, and drives a consistent workflow from detection to resolution.

## What Skylogs Helps You Do

With Skylogs, you can:

- 📥 Collect alerts from multiple observability and monitoring tools
- 🔔 Convert alerts into well-defined incidents
- 🧭 Define escalation rules and on-call schedules
- 📣 Notify teams via email, Slack, SMS, and Microsoft Teams

All of this is available as a **self-hosted, open-source platform** that you fully control.
